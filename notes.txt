 - You can split your app into multiple modules and each module is just a typescript class
 with @NgModule decorator. 
 - Module can imports another module in imports array.
 - Module can export using exports array.
 - Angular have multiple built in module like FormsModule, BroswerModule, RouterModule etc.

 => Create a new component using anuglar cli
 "ng generate component demo"

 => Data Binding
 Data binding is communication between typescript code and template/html code.
  -> Output Data : from typescript code to html
        1. Use string interplation for that. {{someVariable}}
        2. Property Binding. [disabled]="!isAllowed"
  -> React to user events : from html code to typescript.
        1. Event Binding (event)="expression"

=> Two way data binding
FormsModule is required for two way data bindings.
  -> ngModel : [(ngModel)]="inputValue"

=> Directives
Directives are instructions in the DOM
  -> Structural Directives
        1. *ngIf="expression" expression must return a boolean value.

        2. [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor:bgColor}"
            -> ngStyle is used to add dynamic inline styles.
            -> ngStyle directive can also be used to apply styles dynamically with ternary operator.
            [ngStyle]="isError ? {color:'red'}" : {color:'green'}

        3. ngClass: ngClass is used to apply css classes based on some conditions.
            Ex: <div [ngClass]="{'highlight':isHighlighted}">
            expression always return true or false;
        -> [ngStyle] and [ngClass] directive values are key:value pair;
        -> In case of [ngStyle] value is actual value of css property.
        -> In case of [ngStyle] value is boolean expression.

        4. *ngFor: <div *ngFor="let item of items">{{item}}</div>
             To get the index of current iteration use built in keyword 'index'
             Ex: *ngFor = "let item of items; let i = index"
